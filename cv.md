## Summary

Polite and enthusias.c, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. For the last year and a half, I have started to get involved in web programming, such as applica.on development and website development (par.cipated in three small commercial projects). I am looking for a company willing to offer me a place among their developers. In return, I would offer all my commitments and will be a nice and friendly addi.on to your team. Therefore, I am currently looking for a job or
internship as a front-end developer. My goal is to create soEware tailored to the needs of the user, to create applica.ons with a convenient and intui.ve user interface. I also understand the importance of crea.ng readable and maintainable source code. I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and looking for ways to improve myself in this rapidly changing industry. In the coming years, I want to gain enough experience to launch and manage my projects.
